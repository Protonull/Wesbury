### What is Watchdog?

Watchdog is a meta service that aims to bring legal transparency to all the various nations within the world of
Civclassic. It is NOT a prescriptive service that by itself gives credence or legitimacy to particular nations, but
instead describes the legal circumstances of each nation.

### What is a "nation"?

The term "nation" is used solely due to its presence within the average player's lexicon, which has a more intuitive
definition than that of lawyers and philosophers. "Country" would perhaps be a more fitting word, but using anything
other than "nation" would do nothing but produce confusion for the sake of pedanticism. For clarity, we define "nation"
as a distinct place with either the semblance of the Rule of Law, or military defence, or international recognition.

### How do you calculate scores?

Each nation is first considered by its de-jure positions: it's laws, customs, precedents, etc, but the de-facto
experience is considered with greater importance. For example, any nation that claims to have universal Habeas Corpus or
similar, but is actively refusing a fair trial, then that nation's score will be significantly downgraded. Likewise if a
nation has no law ensuring universal Habeas Corpus but has a history of fair trials and proportional sentences, that
nation's score will increase.

### How can scores be contested?

If you believe a given score is unfair, either too high or too low for example, then do not hesitate to get in contact.
The easiest way would be to join the [Wesbury Discord](https://discord.gg/gwrEc2PhWT) and ask for the Watchdog role.
