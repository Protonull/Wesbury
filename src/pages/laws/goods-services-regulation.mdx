title: Regulation of Goods and Services
subtitle: Issued by the Lord Admiral
type: STANDING ORDER
order: 30
current: true

The impact that certain goods and services can have upon the game and its
stability necessitates the establishment of a system of classification to place
limitations upon the such goods and services whether bought or sold, gifted,
donated, inherited, repaid, etc. For the purpose of this law, any and all
circumstances, save for theft, shall be seen under the lens of a buyer and
seller.

- **Class D** is the least restrictive classification for goods and services. Sellers
are expected to have at least minimal protection of their shops and be at least
minimally discerning of their customers.

- **Class C** is more restrictive whereby sellers are expected to have more
substantial but still reasonable protection of their shops as well as being more
discerning of their customers. Sellers should also tend a customer blacklist.

- **Class B** requires sellers to have, at the very least, advanced protection
for their shops, as well as to restrict access to their goods and services via
a blacklist or preferably a whitelist.

- **Class A** is the most restrictive classification reserved for goods and
services that can have a catastrophic impact on the game. Sellers may only sell
to the state, and the state can only sell to entities approved through law.
